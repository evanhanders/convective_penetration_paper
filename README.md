# convective_penetration_paper
Code and supplementary files for the paper, "Stellar convective penetration: parameterized theory and dynamical simulations."

This repository contains:
* A standalone folder (data/ on github; data_and_figures.tar on zenodo) which should be able to reproduce all of the figures in the paper with a standard Dedalus install.
* A standalone folder (dedalus_code/ on github; dedalus_code.tar on zenodo), from which the simulations and initial post-processing were accomplished.
The job_scripts/ sub-folder shows examples of how to run the simulations.
The plotting/ sub-folder was used to do initial post-processing and relies on Evan Anders' plotpal repository (https://github.com/evanhanders/plotpal), and should be functional at commit 02401bf.
* A standalone folder (mesa_model/ on github; mesa_model_and_inlists.tar on zenodo), from which the "solar" model was run.
* A folder containing the manuscript .tex files (only on github).

If there are any questions about interacting with the data, please don't hesitate to contact the first author.
